                <p class="text-muted tex-left">The Kendriya Vidyalayas are a system of central government schools in India that were instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). It comprises over 1,094 schools in India and three abroad. It is one of world's largest chain of schools.

The system came into being in 1963 under the name 'Central Schools'. Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. All the schools are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended (but not restricted) to all central government employees.

A uniform curriculum is followed by these schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face education disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 50 years.

The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, which literally translates to 'Central School Organisation', oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in New Delhi.

The administration of this body is based on levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of Human Resource Development of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is Minister of State of MHRD. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS; there are additional commissioners to accompany Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of a KVS region is Deputy Commissioner accompanied by an Assistant Commissioner. There are individual principals of every KV administrating the schools along with a Vice-Principal, Head Master/ Mistress.

The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system. The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees.</p>

      <h6 class="text-capitalize text-left"><kbd> Art and craft</kbd></h6>
     <p class="text-muted text-left">Arts and crafts can be described as creation or imagination of ideas that are brought to reality by developing naturally inherited skill set that exists among people of any age group. Students are provided extreme liberty by the tutor at arts and craft classes to select the colours and materials of their choice, especially when creating, drawing or developing a piece of artwork and filling colours to it. Arts and crafts classes in Kendriya Vidyalaya No 2 raipur Dd nagar help improve decision making capabilities of students, foster their creative development skills and help them advance and refine their core skills. This boosts their confidence and has a positive impact on their academic achievements. These classes help students pursue their hobbies and augment their critical thinking, reasoning, understanding, learning, and memorising abilities immensely. Students interested in learning drawing skills are taught about the correct posture to hold a paintbrush, pencils or markers. The ones keen towards learning sculptures are taught to build their hand muscles while playing with clay as this is a more physically-demanding form of art. With a free hand provided at arts and crafts classes, students develop their artistic skills, learn to focus on achieving their goals, and become self-leaners by constantly challenging their skills. Through arts and craft classes students learn to work creatively like an artist. They also learn to identify things that appeal their artistic skills and influence the final look of the product, drawing or art created by them.</p>
